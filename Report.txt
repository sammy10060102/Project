Predicting insurance cost based on many factors
  

Content 
Python file in Jupyter Notebook:
* Imported all the libraries.
* Imported CSV .
* Cleaned data ( removing missing values, removing duplicate values).
* Checked for correlation between prices and other factors.
* Plotted data for visualization and debugging.
* Checked for outliers and decide to remove outliers as they are only 4 outliers.
* Categorized BMI into tiers.
* Train, Test, Split data to be used in linear regression model.
* Encoded values into numbers to be used in machine learning.
* Developed some logic to input data into the linear regression equation and output predicted value.
Created Heroku account :
* Deployed UI web app to Heroku via Github connection.
* Attempted to connect the web app to the Python script via API’s but I ran into many problems. I should have just done it using Python Flask and connected the entire Python to Heroku but I ran out of time.
* However, Nodes App have been deployed to Heroku ( no interaction as ran out of time to build Flask ).
